##Contributing

Office UI Fabric is meant to be an evolving snapshot of the Office 365 Design Language - from one of the Microsoft Design Studios that works with it. This means it updates frequently, and exists as a source of truth to help everyone build consistent, Office 365 experiences.

Due to this, some of the fundamental elements - Iconography, Typography, Animations, and Color - aren't intended to be modified unless the official Design Language changes. You should feel free to modify them for your own projects, but Pull Requests proposing modifications or additions in these areas will likely not be accepted.

Missing a glyph in the icon font? Though we don't officially support their use, alternative icon font solutions like [Fontello](http://fontello.com/), [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select), or [Fontastic](http://fontastic.me/) can also be used to fill in those gaps.

**Don't modify CSS (this is just the output of our LESS) or anything in `dist/`.**

We gladly welcome PRs regardingâ€¦
- Bug fixes (of course!)
- Variants on components
- Documentation updates
- Things we haven't thought of yet :-)
	
Please ask before starting a hefty PR so we can let you know if this work is likely to be considered.
